# Cruise-control
Cruise control system use PID control theory and implemented by Python
# My first step
# Aim of the project
The aim of this piece is record my learning of PID control and show the basic knowledge which is need for understanding PID control.
# What's this project
The project aims to create a system of control system to maintain an desired constant speed of a car. The system involved Laplace transform and PID control. We use Python to simulate the motion and we could investigate the effect of PID control theory.
